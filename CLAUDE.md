## Architecture Overview

### Domain-Driven Design Structure

The codebase follows DDD principles with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Domain Layer** (`src/domain/`)
   - **Aggregates**: User, Todo, TodoList - core business entities with business logic
   - **Events**: Domain events for state changes (UserCreated, TodoCreated, etc.)
   - **Value Objects**: Priority, TodoStatus, UserId - immutable domain concepts
   - **Repositories**: Interfaces defining data access contracts

2. **Application Layer** (`src/application/`)
   - **Commands**: Command objects representing user intentions
   - **Handlers**: Command handlers implementing business use cases
   - Uses CQRS pattern - commands for writes, direct queries for reads

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (`src/infrastructure/`)
   - **Persistence**: Prisma-based repository implementations
   - **Container**: Dependency injection setup
   - **Events**: Event publishing and handling infrastructure
   - **AI Services**: Advanced AI/ML capabilities (AdvancedLangChainService, EmbeddingService, NLPService, RAGService)
   - **Security**: Quantum-resistant cryptography, advanced threat detection, policy engines
   - **Edge Computing**: Intelligent CDN optimization, edge computing management
   - **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration, distributed tracing, metrics collection
   - **Collaboration**: Real-time collaboration with operational transforms
   - **Monitoring**: Advanced monitoring with anomaly detection and alerting
   - **Caching**: Multi-level distributed caching with predictive warming
   - **Backup & DR**: Enterprise-grade backup management and disaster recovery orchestration

4. **API Layer** (`src/api/`)
   - **GraphQL Schema**: Pothos-based type-safe schema definitions
   - **Mutations**: GraphQL mutations mapped to application commands
   - **Queries**: GraphQL queries for data retrieval
   - **Server**: GraphQL Yoga server configuration
   - **DataLoaders**: N+1 query optimization

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Event Sourcing**: All domain changes emit events stored in DomainEvent table
- **Repository Pattern**: Domain logic isolated from persistence details
- **Dependency Injection**: IoC container manages dependencies
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from database to GraphQL API
- **Advanced Caching**: Multi-level distributed caching with consistent hashing and predictive warming
- **AI Integration**: LangChain-powered conversational AI with vector embeddings (Qdrant) for semantic search
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket subscriptions with operational transforms for conflict-free collaboration
- **Enterprise Security**: Quantum-resistant cryptography with post-quantum algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+)
- **Edge Computing**: Intelligent CDN optimization with ML-based content distribution
- **Comprehensive Observability**: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing with Prometheus metrics
- **Business Continuity**: Complete backup and disaster recovery infrastructure with automated failover

## Configuration System

The project uses **c12** for configuration management with environment-specific overrides:

- `config/base.config.ts` - Base configuration
- `config/development.config.ts` - Development overrides
- `config/production.config.ts` - Production overrides
- `config/test.config.ts` - Test overrides

### Configuration Usage
```typescript
import { getServerConfig, getSessionConfig, getDatabaseConfig } from './src/config/index.js';

// ✅ Correct - use config functions
const serverConfig = getServerConfig();

// ❌ Wrong - never access process.env directly
const port = process.env.PORT; // Don't do this
```

## Authentication System

### OAuth Providers
- Google OAuth with PKCE support
- GitHub OAuth
- Routes: `/auth/google`, `/auth/github`, and respective callbacks

### Session Management
- H3 sessions with encrypted cookies
- Lucia for auth state management
- Secure session storage in database

### User Management
- Email/password authentication with bcrypt
- Provider account linking
- Session-based authentication for GraphQL

## GraphQL Development

2. Define repository interface in domain layer
3. Implement repository in infrastructure layer
4. Create command and handler in application layer
5. Expose via GraphQL mutation/query in API layer
6. Add appropriate DataLoader if needed
7. Consider AI integration opportunities
8. **Always run `bun run check:types` before committing**

### Enterprise Architecture Development
When working with the advanced enterprise features:

#### Microservices Development
- **Service Registration**: All new services should register with the ServiceRegistry
- **Event Publishing**: Use MessageBroker for all inter-service communication
- **Health Checks**: Implement health endpoints for service mesh integration
- **Circuit Breakers**: Wrap external service calls with circuit breaker patterns
- **Distributed Tracing**: Ensure all operations include trace propagation

#### Multi-Tenant Development
- **Tenant Context**: Always work within a tenant context using MultiTenantManager.createContext()
- **Resource Isolation**: Respect tenant isolation levels (shared, hybrid, dedicated)
- **Usage Tracking**: Track resource usage for billing and quota enforcement
- **Data Partitioning**: Ensure proper data isolation based on tenant configuration

#### Caching Strategy
- **Cache Policies**: Apply appropriate cache policies based on data access patterns
- **Distributed Locks**: Use RedisClusterManager for coordination across services
- **Cache Invalidation**: Follow tag-based invalidation strategies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor cache hit rates and adjust policies accordingly

#### Analytics Integration
- **Metrics Collection**: Use AdvancedAnalytics.recordMetric() for business metrics
- **Custom Queries**: Create analytics queries for new data insights
- **Real-time Data**: Leverage real-time data streams for live dashboards
- **Predictive Models**: Consider ML opportunities for new feature predictions

### Code Organization Principles
- Keep domain logic in aggregates, not in GraphQL resolvers
- Use commands for all state-changing operations
- Repository implementations should only handle data access
- GraphQL layer should be thin, delegating to application layer
- AI services should be event-driven and asynchronous
- Cache invalidation should follow domain events

### Type Safety Requirements
- Leverage Pothos for GraphQL type generation
- Use Prisma's generated types for database operations
- Define explicit types for all command/query parameters
- Never use `any` types - use proper generics instead
- Import types using `type` keyword when appropriate (e.g., `import type { Span }`)

## Common Development Issues

### TypeScript Compilation
- The project is in active modernization with some remaining TypeScript errors
- Always check `bun run check:types` before making changes
- Federation components are currently simplified (placeholder implementations)
- Date objects need `.toISOString()` when passing to domain constructors

### Performance Considerations
- Use DataLoaders for any database queries in GraphQL resolvers
- AI operations are cached - check cache invalidation logic
- Database queries should go through repository pattern
- Complex queries should use query complexity analysis

### AI Feature Development
- Embeddings are generated automatically via domain events
- Vector searches are user-scoped for security
- NLP commands follow specific parsing patterns
- RAG responses include source attribution

## Testing

### Performance Testing
The project includes trace-based performance testing:
```bash
# Run performance tests (when test infrastructure is completed)
bun test src/tests/performance/
```

### Testing Guidelines
- Domain value objects use specific enum values (e.g., `Priority.medium` not `Priority.Medium`)
- Use `undefined` instead of `null` for optional parameters
- Performance tests require specific trace expectations

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure OAuth credentials (Google, GitHub)
3. Set OpenAI API key for AI features
4. Configure Qdrant URL for vector search
5. Set session encryption key
6. Run `bun run services:up` to start all services
7. Run `bun run db:migrate` to initialize database
8. Run `bun run dev` to start development server
